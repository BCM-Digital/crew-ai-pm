## ü§ù Human-in-the-Loop Features

The system includes sophisticated human oversight:

### Approval Workflow

When agents want to take actions, you'll see:

```
============================================================
ü§ù Human Approval Required

Action: create_github_issue
Risk Level: MEDIUM
Description: Create issue for user authentication feature

Proposed Action Details:
  title: "Implement user authentication"
  body: "Add login/logout functionality..."
  assignees: ["alice", "bob"]
  labels: ["feature", "high-priority"]

Options:
  a - Approve action as proposed
  r - Reject action
  m - Modify action parameters
  s - Skip (auto-approve for this session)

What would you like to do? [a]:
```

### Modification Capabilities

You can modify any proposed action:

```
Modify Action Parameters:
Current parameters:
  title: Implement user authentication
  assignees: ["alice", "bob"]

Options:
  <key>=<value> - Set parameter
  done - Finish modifications
  cancel - Cancel modifications

Enter modification: assignees=["charlie"]
Set assignees = ["charlie"]

Enter modification: done
```

## üîß Architecture

### Agents

- **PlannerAgent**: Breaks down projects into tasks, creates issues, assigns work
- **ReporterAgent**: Generates standup reports, sprint summaries, status updates
- **MonitorAgent**: Scans for risks, monitors CI/CD, checks repository health

### Project Context Integration

Every agent automatically knows:
- Which project it's working on
- Team member GitHub usernames
- Current sprint/milestone
- GitHub repository and project details
- Slack channels for communication

### GitHub Integration

- **Issues & PRs**: Create, update, and manage development work
- **GitHub Projects**: Track progress using native GitHub project boards
- **GitHub Actions**: Monitor CI/CD pipelines and trigger workflows
- **Repository Health**: Assess code quality, security, and performance

## üìä Features in Detail

```bash
python main.py interactive
> status
```

Shows:
- GitHub Project board status
- Issue breakdown by status
- Recent activity
- Team workload distribution

### Workflow Integration

Monitor your CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
> workflows
```

## üõ† Advanced Configuration

### Risk Level Settings

Configure automatic approval for different risk levels:

```env
# Auto-approve low-risk actions (creating labels, minor updates)
AUTO_APPROVE_LOW_RISK=true

# Require approval for all actions
HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED=true

# Timeout for approval requests (seconds)
APPROVAL_TIMEOUT=300
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

# Enable GitHub Actions monitoring
GITHUB_ACTIONS_ENABLED=true

# Specify workflow files to monitor
MAIN_WORKFLOW_FILE=.github/workflows/ci.yml
DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW_FILE=.github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

## üìà Workflow Examples

### Daily Standup Flow

1. Agent scans GitHub repository for recent activity
2. Requests approval to generate standup report
3. Fetches data from GitHub Projects, Issues, and PRs
4. Generates formatted report
5. Posts to Slack (with approval)

### Project Planning Flow

1. Human provides project brief via interactive mode
2. Agent requests approval for planning action
3. Breaks down project into tasks and issues
4. Creates GitHub issues with proper assignments
5. Updates project board status
6. Notifies team via Slack

### Risk Monitoring Flow

1. Agent scans repository for risk indicators
2. Checks CI/CD pipeline health
3. Identifies critical issues or security alerts
4. Requests approval for alerting team
5. Creates urgent issues or notifications

## üîí Security & Privacy

- All actions require human approval by default
- Sensitive operations use higher risk levels
- API keys are securely managed via environment variables
- No data is stored outside your environment
- Full audit trail of all interactions

## üö¶ Getting Started Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with `HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED=true` to see all actions
2. **Use Interactive Mode**: It's the best way to collaborate with agents
3. **Configure Project Context**: This makes agents much more effective
4. **Set Up GitHub Projects**: Native integration provides the best experience
5. **Monitor Interactions**: Use `history` command to see what agents are doing

## ü§î Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"GitHub Project ID not configured"**
- Set `GITHUB_PROJECT_ID` in your `.env` file
- Find it in your GitHub Project URL

**"Human approval required but no response"**
- Check your `APPROVAL_TIMEOUT` setting
- Use interactive mode for better experience

**"Permission denied"**
- Verify GitHub token has required permissions
- Check repository access

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:

```env
AGENT_VERBOSE=true
```

## üìö API Reference

### Project Context Object

```python
{
    "project_name": "My Awesome Project",
    "project_description": "Description...",

    "action": {...},  # Approved/modified action
    "message": "User feedback"
}
```
